## Beskrivelse

Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.
